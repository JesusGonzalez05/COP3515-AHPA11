    QUESTIONS

    1) If you had sized the finalExams array based on your class size (5), 
       what just happened when you added scores for two additional students?

    2) If you executed: testPtr = startPtr - endPtr and then tried to store 
       the value "5" in location testPtr, what would happen?
